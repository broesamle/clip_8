`clip_8` | Survival Guide
=========================


Tutorial
--------

`Clip_8` is under heavy development. You will need patience! And it will be fun!

Please check the [Tutorial and Getting Started Issues](https://github.com/broesamle/clip_8/labels/Tutorial%20%2B%20Getting%20Started)
for recent information for users.


Editing SVG files
-----------------

The tutorial assumes you have some experience with
[vector graphics editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics_editor)
and have one ready to export
[Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (SVG) files.
Use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) if you are unsure. It is free and the tutorials were tested with it.

**Do not mix SVG editors.** They each have their dialects. Files you have edited with Illustrator, say, may confuse Inkscape -- resulting in even stranger dialects. Clip_8 might run into trouble understanding such mixed files.

Use the **snap** function! Elements need to be positioned precisely so that clip_8 will find them. Snap makes endpoints and centre points _magnetic_, which makes editing much easier.

If you try other SVG editors with clip_8 may I kindly ask you to [share your experiences](https://github.com/broesamle/clip_8/issues/new).


Get help / report errors
------------------------

If you run into trouble running a program or if you encounter any unexpected behaviours
    please [file an issue](https://github.com/broesamle/clip_8/issues/new) (you need to be signed in on GitHub to do so).
In this early phase, also small error reports can help a lot! Thank you in advance!
Ideally you...

+ ...include the SVG file you used,
+ describe what happened,
+ cite any error messages,
+ tell us which SVG editor, browser, and operating system you were using.
