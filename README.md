`Clip_8`
========

`clip_8` is an arts project.  
It _creates_ the most poetic technical problems you have ever encountered : )

`clip_8` is a programming language.  
Instead of _typing_ source code you _draw_ it.

Programs are given as SVG images. `clip_8` reads the graphics elements and interprets them as instructions; which, in turn, operate on graphics elements. _What you see is what you compute!_

The present project implements an interpreter as a client-side web application. It operates on _inline SVG_ elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web browser.


Getting Started
---------------

[Demos](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/demos/), for a first impression.

[Tutorial](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tutorial/), draw and execute an SVG.

For recent user information please check the [Tutorial and Getting Started Issues](https://github.com/broesamle/clip_8/labels/Tutorial%20%2B%20Getting%20Started).

Philosophy / Inspiration
------------------------

As an artist I wanted to create a programming language that can be understood in an intuitive way, just as cutting or folding paper.
As a low tech material, paper recalls the fact that information processing ultimately relies on cause and effect in physical matter:
Electrical chain reactions in silicon ... or cutting, moving, folding, and aligning pieces of cardboard.

In `clip_8` all operations and data are graphical elements. During execution the user can observe program execution: Instructions and data appear in the same view. This follows from the desire to continuously observe the complete machine state during program execution.


Language documentation / Integration tests
------------------------------------------

The integration tests are provided in [Reference Test Sheets](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tests/) which serve as _language reference_, simultaneously.
