`Clip_8`
========

The iconic programming language `clip_8` is inspired by the principles of manipulating cardboard pieces with a cutter. `Move`, `align`, `cut`, `transform` are all operations that can be intuitively grasped. 

Each operation applies to graphical content. The instructions, in turn, are themselves given in a graphical form. During execution, instructions and data appear in the same view. 

The present project implements an interpreter as a client-side web application. It operates on _inline SVG_ elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web browser.


Demos

Try the [Tutorial](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tutorial/). It is **work in progress!** But it can give you an idea what `clip_8` is about.


Language documentation / Integration tests
------------------------------------------

The integration tests are provided in [Reference Test Sheets](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tests/) which serve as _language reference_, simultaneously.
