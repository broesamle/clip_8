`Clip_8`
========

`Clip_8` is an iconic programming language inspired by _paper manipulation_ operations. `Move`, `align`, `cut`, `transform` are all operations that can be intuitively comprehended as manipulations of cartonage pieces. These external counterparts serve as physical models for elementary mental concepts of calculation.

While each operation applies to graphical content, the instructions, in turn, are themselves given in a graphical form.

The present project implements an interpreter as a client-side web application. It operates on _inline SVG_ elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web browser.

`Klippen`
---------

[Drop and execute your drawing](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/demos/klippen.html) in an interactive test environment.


Language documentation / Integration tests
------------------------------------------

The integration tests are provided in [Reference Test Sheets](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tests/) which serve as _language reference_, simultaneously.


Compatibility / Browser support
-------------------------------

Clip_8 makes extensive use of _inline SVG_, _JS_, and the _DOM_. Not all browsers implement all required parts of the
[SVG DOM Interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#DOMInterfaces]), i.e. `SVGElement.getIntersectionList` provides crucial functionality (successfully tested only in Google Chrome (TM), at the time of writing).

Please check [Issue 9](https://github.com/broesamle/clip_8/issues/9) and related issues for more information on browser support.
