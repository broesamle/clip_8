`Clip_8`
========

**What you see is what you compute.**

`clip_8` is probably best described as a _visual virual machine_ operating on inline SVG in the DOM.

+ All instructions and data are graphical SVG elements.

+ The programmer can, hence, observe the entire machine state during program execution.

+ Implemented in JavaScript and Rust (via Web Assembly)


How it works
------------

Instead of written (text-based) code, programs are SVG images with a particular arrangement of geometric elements.

clip_8 interprets the SVG image:

1. Decode the arrangement of circles, lines, rectangles, paths, polygones as _instructions_, _control flow_, and _data_.

2. _Execute_ one instruction after the other.

    a) _Instructions_ manipulate the _data_ elements, i.e. _cut_, _align_, _resize_, or _move_ them.

    b) _Control flow_, defines the order of instructions, alternatives etc.


Web Assembly
------------

+ An experimental [Web Assembly](http://webassembly.org/) module uses [ncollide](http://ncollide.org/) to retrieve rectangles based on their location.

+ Tested in Chrome, Firefox

+ Credits go to Andrew Hobden, whose article [The Path to Rust on the Web](http://asquera.de/blog/2017-04-10/the-path-to-rust-on-the-web/) helped a lot in getting Rust and JavaScript to talk to each other.


Getting Started
---------------

[Demos](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/demos/), for a first impression.

[Tutorial](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tutorial/), draw and execute an SVG.

Philosophy / Inspiration
------------------------

**Programming should be as easy as cutting and folding paper or modelling a piece of clay.**

+ No code to be written.

+ Instructions and data are expressed in an intuitive format.

+ Program expression and technical execution are close together, ideally in the same (graphic) medium.


Language documentation / Integration tests
------------------------------------------

The integration tests are provided in [Reference Test Sheets](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tests/) which serve as _language reference_, simultaneously.


Building
--------

For generating **demos**, **tutorials** and **reference test pages** checkout python the scripts in `bin`.

For the **wasm** modules use `make` in the `rs` directory.
