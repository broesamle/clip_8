`Clip_8`
========



**Programming should be as easy as cutting and folding paper or modelling a piece of clay.**

`clip_8` is an arts project and programming language following that ideal.

+ No code to be written.

+ Instructions and data are expressed in terms of arranged geometric primitives.

+ What you see is what you compute.

+ The programmer can observe the entire <q>machine</q> state during program execution.

+ The interpreter is implemented JavaScript and operates on inline SVG in the DOM.


Overview
--------

Instead of typing code in an editor the  programmer _draws_ an SVG image.

The interpreter interprets the SVG image as follows:

1. Decode the arrangement of elements (circles, lines, etc.) as _instructions_, _control flow_, and _data_.

2. _Execute_ one instruction after the other.

    a) _Instructions_ manipulate the _data_ elements, i.e. _cut_, _align_, _resize_, or _move_ them.

    b) _Control flow_, defines order of instructions, alternatives etc.


Web Assembly
------------

+ An experimental [Web Assembly](http://webassembly.org/) module uses [ncollide](http://ncollide.org/) to retrieve rectangles based on their location.

+ Tested in Chrome, Firefox

+ Credits go to Andrew Hobden, whose article [The Path to Rust on the Web](http://asquera.de/blog/2017-04-10/the-path-to-rust-on-the-web/) helped a lot in getting Rust and JavaScript to talk to each other.


Getting Started
---------------

[Demos](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/demos/), for a first impression.

[Tutorial](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tutorial/), draw and execute an SVG.

For recent user information please check the [Tutorial and Getting Started Issues](https://github.com/broesamle/clip_8/labels/Tutorial%20%2B%20Getting%20Started).

Philosophy / Inspiration
------------------------

As an artist I wanted to create a programming language that can be understood in an intuitive way, just as cutting or folding paper.
As a low tech material, paper recalls the fact that information processing ultimately relies on cause and effect in physical matter:
Electrical chain reactions in silicon ... or cutting, moving, folding, and aligning pieces of cardboard.

In `clip_8` all operations and data are graphical elements. During execution the user can observe program execution: Instructions and data appear in the same view. This follows from the desire to continuously observe the complete machine state during program execution.


Language documentation / Integration tests
------------------------------------------

The integration tests are provided in [Reference Test Sheets](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tests/) which serve as _language reference_, simultaneously.


Building
--------

For generating **demos**, **tutorials** and **reference test pages** checkout python the scripts in `bin`.

For the **wasm** modules use `make` in the `rs` directory.
