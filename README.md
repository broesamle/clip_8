`clip_8`
========

**What you see is what you compute.**

`clip_8` is probably best described as a _visual virtual machine_ operating on inline SVG in the DOM.

+ Instructions and data are implemented as graphical SVG elements.

+ Graphics elements are visible to humans, just as any other SVG graphics in a web page.

+ `clip_8` interprets them as instructions of a purely visual programming language.

+ The programmer can observe the entire machine state during program execution.


How it works
------------

The programs can be drawn in vector graphics editors which support SVG output.

clip_8 interprets the SVG image:

1. Decode the arrangement of circles, lines, rectangles, paths, polygones as _instructions_, _control flow_, and _data_.

2. _Execute_ one instruction after the other.

    a) _Instructions_ manipulate the _data_ elements, i.e. _cut_, _align_, _resize_, or _move_ them.

    b) _Control flow_, defines the order of instructions, alternatives etc.


Why?
----

`clip_8` was designed as a [visual thought experiment](https://github.com/broesamle/clip8_materials/blob/master/visual-thought-experiments.md).

On [visuelle-maschine.de](https://visuelle-maschine.de/index-en.html)
you will find more technical projects with a strong commitment on visual experimentation.


Getting Started

[Demos](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/demos/), for a first impression.

[Tutorial](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tutorial/), learn the language and the tricks.

For recent user information please check the [Tutorial and Getting Started Issues](https://github.com/broesamle/clip_8/labels/Tutorial%20%2B%20Getting%20Started).

[Klippen](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tutorial/klippen.html), try `clip_8` online (no installation required).


Browser compatibility
---------------------

+ An experimental [Web Assembly](http://webassembly.org/) module uses [ncollide](http://ncollide.org/) to retrieve rectangles based on their location.

+ Tested in Chrome, Firefox

+ Credits go to Andrew Hobden, whose article [The Path to Rust on the Web](http://asquera.de/blog/2017-04-10/the-path-to-rust-on-the-web/) helped a lot in getting Rust and JavaScript to talk to each other.

To run on a local machine, please use a local http server, e.g.:

```
python -m http.server
```


Tests / Language documentation
------------------------------

The integration tests are provided in [Reference Test Sheets](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tests/) which serve as _language reference_, simultaneously.


Building
--------

If you want to make changes to `clip_8` yourself you might need to do some or all of the following:

**Note:** These steps are not necessary for [using `clip_8` online via Klippen](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tutorial/klippen.html).


### build the web assembly module

For the **wasm** modules use `make` in the `rs` directory.

### build html pages

If you wand to make changes to the demos, tutorials, or tests, the html pages will need a rebuild. Python scripts in `bin` support these steps:

Build Demos: `python svg2demo.py`

Build the Tutorials: `python buildTutorial.py`

Build the Reference Test Sheets: `python svg2refsheet.py`


Dependencies
------------

+ [Python-Markdown](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/):
`pip install Markdown` or `python -m pip install Markdown`

+ [tinycss](https://pypi.org/project/tinycss/)
`pip install tinycss` or `python -m pip install tinycss`

+ The utilities in [PyBroeModules](https://github.com/broesamle/PyBroeModules) are currently available as a github project, only. You can clone the project and copy/link the project directory in your local python `site-packages`.
