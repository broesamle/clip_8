`Clip_8`
========

`Clip_8` is an iconic programming language inspired by _paper manipulation_ operations. `Move`, `align`, `cut`, `transform` are all operations that can be intuitively comprehended as manipulations of cartonage pieces. These external counterparts serve as physical models for elementary mental concepts of calculation.

While each operation applies to graphical content, the instructions, in turn, are themselves given in a graphical form.

The present project implements an interpreter as a client-side web application. It operates on _inline SVG_ elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web browser.


Tutorial and online Interpreter
-------------------------------

[Tutorials (alpha)](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tutorial/), WORK IN PROGRESS!!

Drop and execute your drawing in [Klippen](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tutorial/klippen.html), an online test environment.


Language documentation / Integration tests
------------------------------------------

The integration tests are provided in [Reference Test Sheets](https://broesamle.github.io/clip_8/tests/) which serve as _language reference_, simultaneously.
