<p>
clip_8 was designed as a visual thought experiment. <a href="http://visuelle-maschine.de/index-en.html" target="_blank">visuelle-maschine.de</a> gives some background on the <a href="http://visuelle-maschine.de/index-en.html" target="_blank">philosophy behind visual thought experiments</a>.
</p>
<p>
For clip_8 the role of SVG graphics is twofold: (1) Graphics elements are visible to humans as any other SVG graphics. (2) The clip_8 interpreter will read them as instructions. The programs can be drawn in vector graphics editors which support SVG output.
</p>
<p>
The tutorial assumes you have some experience with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics_editor" target="_blank">vector graphics editors</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you get stuck, please <b>read the <a href="../survival-guide.html" target="_blank">Survival Guide</a>!</b> as the tutorials and clip_8 are in an experimental state.
</p>
<p>
<a href="00_gettingStarted.html">Happy drawing!</a>
